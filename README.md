# AnyKnee
AnyKnee plays on the concept of 'Any' and [...]. 

The original models were developed by [Christine Dzialo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christine-dzialo-111AAU/)
at Aalborg University (AAU, Aalborg, Denmark) as part of her PhD work. Then implemented as a scaled moving-axis model when she joined the AnyBody Technology team in 2019.

The LIOAnyEpaule model consists in an inverse dynamic musculoskeletal model for
shoulder griddle study. More specifically, it has been developed with the
objective to be used for non-conforming total shoulder arthroplasty (NC-TSA)
evaluation. Development, verification, and validation of this model were one of
the objectives of a Ph.D. study. Method and results are published in the Journal
of Biomechanical Engineering:

*NB:* Due to copyright restrictions, the glenoid and humeral component's files
are not the same than the one used in the published paper. The provided STL
models are CAO custom made models, that do not correspond to any commercially
available implant. For this reason, results when using the model as is will
necessarily be different
